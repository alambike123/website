summary: 
abstract: "Does student loan debt discourage political participation? Presidential candidates are increasing their campaign efforts on policies of student loan forgiveness, thereby assuming that such proposals would mobilize a body of voters to turnout. However, such implicit claims have yet to be tested. We argue that student loan holders are a subconstituency whose attitudes towards the issue can be activated given relevant messages. Using data on individual- and county-level measures of student debt, we show that student loan holders are more likely to support candidates who make appeals directly to their situation, and the debtors are motivated primarily by self-interest. The robustness of these findings remains after estimating placebo checks and propensity score matching models. The article contributes to an underdeveloped literature by showing that the student loan debt crisis has significant ramifications for political behavior and that socio-economic stressors are qualitatively different than debt for political behavior."
